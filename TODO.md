# TODO

 * add auto-untrack flag for files that no longer exist at the tracked path
 * don't attempt to track files if they can't be read at the indicated path (config flag for warning)
 * format-string options for `--source-command` arg (e.g. `%fn` -> full path, `%dir` -> file dir, `%n` -> file name, `%t` -> tracker-time)

 * add testing harness
   - make more shell agnostic
